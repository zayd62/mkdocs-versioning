Design \u00b6 mkdocs-versioning is designed with the following principles in mind: Theme/Plugin agnostic : The plugin should work with any mkdocs theme/plugin. The plugin works by taking advantage of the navigation links to implement versioning . Strict versioning : Once a documentation is built, it should NOT be overwritten. mkdocs-versioning uses a centralised, continuously updated version selection page which then, using the navigation links, point to built docs. The built docs then have a relative link which then points to the version selection page. Stateless : Stateless means that no extra information is stored anywhere in order for the plugin to work. All the plugin needs is the previously built docs, a new version number and it can build the new docs, the version selection page and have the previous verions of the built docs available and accessible. Install \u00b6 It is highly recommended that you use Python Virtual Environments so not pollute your system install of Python. Once you create and activate your python environment, use pip to install the plugin. Requires Python version \u2265 3.6. pip install mkdocs pip install mkdocs-versioning Tip An alternative for managing Virtual Environments is Anaconda Navigator which provides a nice GUI for managing python virtual environments. Setup \u00b6 Once install is complete, use mkdocs new . to create an empty mkdocs project. You should then have an mkdocs.yml file as well as a docs/ directory. Now setup mkdocs.yml as shown below ( Note : You can add more to the config if you wish. This is just the minimum): Example plugins : - mkdocs-versioning : version : 0.3.0 nav : - Home : \"index.md\" - Version Selector : \"../\" Write your documentation as normal using mkdocs serve to preview your docs as normal. When you run mkdocs build , the plugin will: Build your docs into a folder within site/ and will be named according to the value of version (in the example, the docs will be built into site/0.3.0/ ). Remove the old version selection page. Inside site/ build a new version selection page. Now when you want to build a new version, simply change the value of version (e.g. to 0.4.0) and build again, mkdocs should build the new, updated docs into its own folder and update the version selection page.

The following steps occur after a single mkdocs build command. 1. Building the main docs \u00b6 1.1 Pre-build \u00b6 The main documentation will be built into site/ in a folder equivalent to the version value in mkdocs.yml . The documentation will have the version number of the docs appended to the site_name value specified in mkdocs.yml . Example built docs directory. For version: 0.1.0 , the docs will be built in the directory site/0.1.0/... . The ... means files ( CSS , JS , HTML , etc) that are generated by mkdocs will be built into here. If a custom version selection page is specified, it is hidden by prefixing the filename with a . ( version_selection.md \u2192 .version_selection.md ). A custom version selection page can be specified as a plugin config option. Example mkdocs.yml with custom version selection page. plugins : - mkdocs-versioning : version : 0.3.0 version_selection_page : \"version_selection.md\" nav : - Home : \"index.md\" - Version Selector : \"../\" Post-build \u00b6 Once the docs have been built into its folder in the site directory, the custom version selection page (if specified) will be unhidden by removing the prefixed . from the filename ( .version_selection.md \u2192 version_selection.md ). Warning: Renaming files. The process of hiding uses Path.replace() from the pathlib module in order to rename files. Should the renaming fail, you may have markdown files with . prefixed onto the filename. A CLI command unhide_docs will remove the prefixed . from your markdown files. 2. Clearing out old version selection page \u00b6 The plugin then, in the site directory, removes all the files related to the version selection page. Since the built docs are in their own folders within the site directory, we can delete all the files in the root of the site directory, folders explicitly specified by the plugin as well as any user specified folders using the exclude_from_nav config option for the plugin. This option allows you to specify a list of directories the the plugin will ignore. This will then leave us with site/ containing only folders named according to previous and current version numbers and in each folder, the previous and current built documentation. Example mkdocs.yml with exclude_from_nav config option. plugins : - mkdocs-versioning : version : 0.3.0 exclude_from_nav : [ \"images\" ] nav : - Home : \"index.md\" - Version Selector : \"../\" 2.1 Why exclude_from_nav option \u00b6 mkdocs allows you have any files related to the building of the docs in the docs directory, this includes non-markdown files such as a folder containing images, stylesheets and more. The default behaviour of mkdocs is to copy these folders into the site directory where the built docs live. Since the building of the version selection page depends on the root of the site directory, you may have additional options (e.g. images, stylesheets) appearing in the version selection page. This option will exclude these options appearing on the version selection page as different versions of your documentation. 3. Building version selection page \u00b6 Since we are building the version selection page, we hide all the other docs by prefixing the filename with a . as mentioned in Step 1.1 . If a custom version selection markdown file is specified, we then unhide the version selection page and rename it to index.md . If a custom version selection markdown file is not specified, the plugin writes a basic version selection markdown file. After clearing the site directory, the only thing that should be left is a set of folders where each folder represents a different version. The folder names are used to create a nav in another separate mkdocs.version.yml file. mkdocs build is then triggered using the internal mkdocs API and the version selection page is then built into the root of the site directory. 4. Clean up \u00b6 Once the version selection page is built, the building of the docs is considered complete and all the HTML , CSS and JS has been generated. Since we hid the documentation in Step 3 , we then unhide the docs with special handling for the version selection page. If a custom version selection markdown file is specified, we then rename the version selection page from index.md to whatever it was initially called. If a custom version selection markdown file is not specified, we then delete the version selection markdown file as it was generated by the plugin itself.","title":"How it works"},{"location":"reference/#how-it-works","text":"This page will describe how the plugin works by talking about the internal workings about the plugin.
