# mkdocs-versioning

mkdocs-versioning is a plugin for [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), a
tool designed to create static websites usually for generating project
documentation. mkdocs-versioning extends mkdocs by differentiating
between different versions of documentation you may build. For example,
a newer versions of some software may work differently from an older
version and it is important that users of an older version of the
software reads the appropriate version of the documentation in order to
ensure that the user has the correct information and uses the software
appropriately.
