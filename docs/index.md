Welcome to the InvenioRDM project!

InvenioRDM is a ready-to-go, turn-key Research Data Management repository. It
puts together the Invenio framework so you don't have to.

This documentation walks you through installing, configuring, and deploying
your very own InvenioRDM instance. Furthermore, you can customize it for your
needs and even add your own extensions! Follow the sections below in order to
get a full picture of how to use InvenioRDM, or go straight to what you're interested
in - each section is independent.


## Install

To get started with InvenioRDM, you will want to install `invenio-cli`, our
command line tool for creating and updating your instance. This tool in turn
allows you to easily install an instance and manage it.

configure, customize, debug, and iterate -, you will want to setup your project
for development. Various commands are at your disposal and we walk you through
the workflow for how to be effective with them.
